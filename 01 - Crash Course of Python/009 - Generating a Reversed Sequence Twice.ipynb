    "# **Generating a Reversed Sequence Twice**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt:\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a Python function called `sequence(low, high)` that prints a reversed sequence of numbers twice. The function should take two parameters, `low` and `high`, where `low` represents the starting number and `high` represents the ending number. The sequence should start from `high` and end at `low`, inclusive, printing each number separated by commas. Your task is to complete the function with the necessary loops and logic to achieve the desired output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Guide:\n",
    "1. Define a Python function called `sequence(low, high)` with two parameters: `low` and `high`.\n",
    "2. Begin an outer loop that runs twice, as indicated by the prompt. Use the `range()` function with an argument of `2` to accomplish this.\n",
    "3. Inside the outer loop, initiate an inner loop using the `range()` function. This loop should iterate from `high` down to `low`, inclusive. To achieve this, set the starting value of the range as `high`, the ending value as `low - 1`, and the step as `-1` to decrement the loop.\n",
    "4. Within the inner loop, check if the current value (`y`) is equal to `low`. If it is, print `y` without a trailing comma, indicating the end of the sequence.\n",
    "5. If the current value is not equal to `low`, print `y` followed by a comma and a space to separate the numbers.\n",
    "6. After the inner loop completes, the function will print the reversed sequence twice, each separated by a newline character.\n",
