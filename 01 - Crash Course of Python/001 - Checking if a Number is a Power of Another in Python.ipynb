    "**Exercise Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function named `is_power_of` that takes two parameters: `number` and `base`. This function should determine if **number** is a power of **base**. The function should return `True` if **number** is a power of **base**, otherwise, it should return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Solution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a function called `is_power_of` that takes two parameters: **number** and **base**.\n",
    "2. In the function body, establish a base case: if **number** is less than **base**, check if **number** is equal to 1. If so, return `True`, as any number raised to 0 equals 1.\n",
    "3. If **number** is not less than **base**, make a recursive call to `is_power_of` by dividing **number** by **base**. This is done to check if **number** can be reduced to 1 through repeated division by **base**.\n",
    "4. Continue repeating step 3 until **number** is less than **base**.\n",
    "5. Finally, if the number is reduced to 1, return `True`, indicating that **number** is a power of **base**. Otherwise, return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach utilizes recursion to divide the original number by the base until one of the base conditions is met, determining whether the number is a power of the base or not.\n"
