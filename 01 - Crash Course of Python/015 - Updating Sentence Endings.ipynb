    "# Updating Sentence Endings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statement:**  \n",
    "You've been tasked with creating a function that updates the ending of a given sentence with a new substring. Your goal is to replace the old substring at the end of the sentence with the new substring provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Guide:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**  \n",
    "   Begin by defining a function named `replace_ending` that takes three parameters: `sentence`, `old`, and `new`.\n",
    "2. **Check Ending:**  \n",
    "   Inside the function, use the `endswith()` method to check if the `sentence` ends with the `old` substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate Slicing Index:**  \n",
    "   If the `old` substring is found at the end of the `sentence`, calculate the slicing index `i`. This index is obtained by subtracting the length of the `old` substring from the length of the `sentence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Replace Ending:**  \n",
    "   With the slicing index `i`, slice the `sentence` up to the matched string at the end and combine it with the `new` substring.\n",
    "5. **Return Updated Sentence:**  \n",
    "   Return the `new_sentence` if the `old` substring is replaced successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Fallback:**  \n",
    "   If the `old` substring is not found at the end of the `sentence`, return the original `sentence`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Testing:**  \n",
    "   Test the function with different scenarios to ensure its correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Finalization:**  \n",
    "   Ensure the function works as expected by running the provided test cases. Adjust the function as necessary to handle any edge cases or unexpected behavior."
