The `csv` module provides functions and classes that facilitate the reading, writing, and manipulation of data in CSV files. By importing this module, we ensure that we have access to all these necessary functionalities to handle CSV files efficiently and without errors. The common method to import the `csv` module is simply using the statement `import csv`."
