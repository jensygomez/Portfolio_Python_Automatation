You can add this document to your cybersecurity portfolio, which you can share with prospective employers or recruiters. To review the importance of building a professional portfolio and options for creating your portfolio, read [Create a cybersecurity portfolio](https://www.coursera.org/learn/automate-cybersecurity-tasks-with-python/resources/Xku4r).\n",

You will explain the code you developed in that lab, and this will help you prepare for future job interviews and other steps in the hiring process.\n",

    "You are a security professional working at a health care company. As part of your job, you're required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also a remove list that identifies which employees you must remove from this allow list.\n",

(You do not need to reference Task 1 and Tasks 8-10 of the lab to complete this portfolio activity.) You should revisit the lab to get screenshots to include in your portfolio document.\n",
